# 🧩 Industrial Control Systems (ICS) – Core Components

## ⚙️ ICS Layers

1. **Field Level**: Sensors, actuators  
2. **Control Level**: PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), RTUs  
3. **Supervisory Level**: SCADA systems, HMI  
4. **Enterprise Level**: IT systems, ERP, databases

## 🖧 Key Components

- **SCADA** – Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition  
- **DCS** – Distributed Control Systems  
- **PLCs** – Hardware that automates industrial processes  
- **HMI** – Human Machine Interface for monitoring and control

## 🌉 Protocols Used

- Modbus, DNP3, OPC, IEC 60870  
- Often unencrypted and unauthenticated (legacy weakness)
