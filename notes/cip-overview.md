# 🛡️ Critical Infrastructure Protection – Overview

## 📌 What Is Critical Infrastructure (CI)?

Critical Infrastructure refers to assets and systems vital to national security, economy, public health, and safety. It includes:

- Energy (electric grids, oil pipelines)
- Water systems
- Transportation
- Communications
- Financial institutions
- Government facilities

## 🔐 Why Protection Matters

- Disruption may lead to national-scale emergencies
- Common targets of cyberattacks and terrorism
- Increasing integration of IT and OT = larger attack surface

## 🧠 Core Protection Goals (C-I-A + R)

- **Confidentiality** – Prevent unauthorized access  
- **Integrity** – Ensure accurate, untampered data  
- **Availability** – Ensure uptime and service continuity  
- **Resilience** – Ability to recover quickly from disruption
