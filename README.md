## 📝 Course Review: Introduction to CIP – ICIP OSWAT

This course serves as a strong primer for anyone interested in the **protection of industrial control systems**. It blends policy, governance, and technical models into a well-structured format.

✅ **What I Liked**:
- Clear separation between IT and OT threat models
- Focus on real-world ICS examples (PLC, HMI, SCADA)
- Hands-on examples encouraged contextual thinking

📌 **To Improve**:
- Would benefit from lab challenges (e.g., identifying misconfigurations)
- Could include more modern threats like ransomware in OT

## 🚧 Ongoing Work

Additional deep-dive demos and strategy docs (e.g., `ICS Forensics`) are in progress.
